Researcher at TIB – Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology and PhD Candidate at Leibniz University Hannover. I focus on information retrieval, semantic technologies, and knowledge graphs, building intelligent systems that make scientific knowledge more accessible and connected.

I collaborate with the Lab Knowledge Infrastructures and contribute to the ORKG (Open Research Knowledge Graph) project, applying semantic methods to support research discovery and interoperability across digital platforms.

Previously, I was a researcher at the L3S Research Center, working on projects at the intersection of the semantic web and information retrieval. I have twice received the Best Paper Award, highlighting my commitment to impactful research.

My technical skills include Python and knowledge graph technologies, and I am pursuing a hybrid career path bridging academic research and industry R&D.
